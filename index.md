## Getting Started

To get started with the EcMarkup datasets, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/ranfiner/AI2001_Category-Source_Code-SC-EcMarkup/releases). Make sure to download the appropriate files for your needs.

### Prerequisites

Before using the datasets, ensure you have the following:

- A working installation of Python (version 3.6 or higher).
- Basic understanding of programming concepts.

## Datasets

The repository features several datasets that are useful for various AI applications. These datasets include:

- **EcMarkup Syntax Dataset**: A collection of examples showcasing the syntax of the EcMarkup language.
- **EcMarkup Functionality Dataset**: This dataset includes different functionalities that can be implemented using EcMarkup.
- **Training Datasets**: Various datasets to train AI models using EcMarkup.

Each dataset is structured to facilitate easy access and usage.

## Installation

To set up the repository locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ranfiner/AI2001_Category-Source_Code-SC-EcMarkup.git
